The current implementation of the Java/MCL connector is based off the
TCP/Server code. It can be checked out from CVS as an Eclipse project,
using the module name 'JavaTCPMCL'.

The JNI implementation has been discontinued.

The java directory in the MCL distribution root contains java code
that can be used in support of the MCL Library. This includes but is
not limited to the CPT Editor. It should not be used as a repository
location for Java-MCL interoperability code.
