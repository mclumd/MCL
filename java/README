CPT Editor
8/8/2011 Matt Schmill

A basic CPT editor tool for MCL's CPTs. Implemented in Java/Swing.
Requires ant and java.

Build the project using "ant" in the directory where build.xml is located.
Execute the editor as follows:

  java -classpath build/jar/MCLUI.jar mcl.config.ui.cptEditor <ontology> [domain] [agent] [controller]

if domain/agent/controller are ommitted, "default" will be used.
The file that will be worked on will be 

  $(MCL_CONFIG_PATH)/config/default/<ontology>_cpt.mcl
  $(MCL_CONFIG_PATH)/config/<domain>/<ontology>_cpt.mcl
  $(MCL_CONFIG_PATH)/config/<domain>/<agent>/<ontology>_cpt.mcl
  $(MCL_CONFIG_PATH)/config/<domain>/<agent>/<controller>/<ontology>_cpt.mcl

Once you are into the editor, you can list the nodes by typing "list".
You can set all the evidence node priors to 0 by typing "putblanks".

You can save the cpt file by writing "save <node>" where <node> is the name of a node
